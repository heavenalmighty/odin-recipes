    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>This New York cheesecake is dense and rich. It includes a great technique for letting the cheesecake finish in the oven so that no cracks form as the cake cools. It's a favorite dessert of mine served with my fresh strawberry sauce.</p>
<br>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>18 graham crackers, crushed</li>
<li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream</li>
<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
<li>2/3 cup milk</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
<li>1 teaspoom fomely grated orange zest</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degress F (175 degress C). Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9- inch springform pan.</li>
<br><li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan</li>
<br><li>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
<br><li>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
<br><li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
<br><li>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
</ol>
